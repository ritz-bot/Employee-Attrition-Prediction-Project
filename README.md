# Employee Attrition Prediction Project

Welcome to this exciting hands-on project! In this project, we will predict which employees in a company are more likely to leave. Understanding why employees leave, why they stay, and how to motivate them is crucial for any business. We will explore the reasons behind employee attrition and build predictive models to identify employees who are at risk of leaving the organization.

## Business Case

Employee attrition is a major challenge for companies. Hiring and retaining top talent is essential for maintaining productivity and achieving business goals. The cost of losing an employee includes not only the direct costs of recruitment but also the indirect costs of lost knowledge, reduced productivity, and the time taken to bring a new hire up to speed. Therefore, it is vital to identify and address the factors that contribute to employee turnover to minimize these costs and retain valuable employees.

### Key Facts:
- Small business owners spend 40% of their working hours on tasks that do not generate any income, such as hiring.
- Companies spend around 15% to 20% of an employee's salary to recruit a new candidate.
- An average company loses 1% to 2.5% of their total revenue due to the time it takes to bring a new hire up to speed.
- Hiring a new employee costs an average of $7,600 for companies with 0 to 500 employees and takes about 52 days to fill a position.

## Problem Statement

As a data scientist at a multinational corporation, you are tasked with predicting which employees are likely to leave the company. The HR team has collected extensive data on employees, including factors such as job involvement, education, job satisfaction, performance, relationship satisfaction, and work-life balance. Your goal is to analyze this data and build models that can accurately predict employee attrition.

## Project Tasks

1. **Understand the Problem Statement and Business Case**: Gain a clear understanding of why employees leave and the impact of attrition on the business.
2. **Import Libraries and Dataset**: Load the necessary libraries and dataset for analysis.
3. **Visualize the Dataset**: Perform data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand the data distribution and relationships.
4. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Create training and testing datasets and perform data cleaning.
5. **Learn Classifiers**: Understand the intuition behind different classifiers including Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks, and Random Forest Classifier.
6. **Model Assessment**: Learn how to assess the classifiers using metrics such as confusion matrices and F1 scores.
7. **Train and Evaluate Models**: Train and evaluate Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network models on the dataset.

## Approach

1. **Task 1: Problem Statement and Business Case**
   - Understand the significance of employee attrition and the business impact.
   - Explore the factors that contribute to employee turnover.

2. **Task 2: Import Libraries and Dataset**
   - Import the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
   - Load the dataset provided by the HR team.

3. **Task 3: Visualize the Dataset**
   - Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that highlight key patterns and insights in the data.

4. **Task 4: Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Clean the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

5. **Task 5: Learn Classifiers**
   - Study the principles of Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks, and Random Forest Classifier.
   - Understand how these classifiers can be used to predict employee attrition.

6. **Task 6: Model Assessment**
   - Assess the performance of the models using confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

7. **Task 7, 8, 9: Train and Evaluate Models**
   - Train and evaluate the Logistic Regression model.
   - Train and evaluate the Random Forest model.
   - Train and evaluate the Artificial Neural Network model.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, you will have a comprehensive understanding of employee attrition, the factors that influence it, and how to build predictive models to identify employees at risk of leaving. This knowledge will help your organization to take proactive measures to retain top talent and minimize the costs associated with employee turnover.

Let's get started with Task 1 and understand the problem statement and business case in more detail!
